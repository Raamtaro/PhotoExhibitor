# Photo Exhibitor React<>Vite FrontEnd

This project is a play off of this demo from codrops: https://tympanus.net/Tutorials/ShaderOnScroll/

The end user will be able to sign-in to the frontend and then create collections which contain images. Their images will then be rendered into its own page, laid out in a similar fashion to the codrops tutorial with the same shader effect applied.

After this core functionality is created, the features will be extended to include:

- At least two more shader effects - including an RGB Offset/shift effect
- Customizable background colouring
- Maybe an entirely different scene and some postprocessing effects


I've been learning a lot of server-side programming lately, and wanted to tie that together with the Three JS tinkering I've also been doing for fun. Making a fullstack project to add to my portfolio is the convenient cherry on top.
